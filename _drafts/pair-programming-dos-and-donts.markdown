There are several things that will make your pair programming sessions
work better. Things you can actively do and others best to avoid.

First of all you need to give it an honest shot, specially if you're
not experienced in pairing. Pair programming is a skill and needs to
be learned. Like learning any other thing the process can be though,
it can take you out of your comfort zone and get your mind wanting to
do things as usual. So it's important to be open about the experience
and try to make the best of it.<!-- -**-END-**- -->

Communication is crucial, you need to talk to your partner and learn
to listen. There is a quote by Donald Knuth which I really like that
says: *"Programming is the art of telling another human being what one
wants the computer to do"*. This has always stuck with me since I read
it and when you're pairing it applies even more. That's the essence of
it. Effective listening is necessary, it can get difficult to listen
to others and be open about their suggestions when you're off with
your thoughts and going really fast, you need to be conscious about
the interaction you have with your peer.

Code written by a pair is a construction of the best ideas of the two
people and in order to get those best ideas things need to be
challenged. You'll need to convince your partner and in some
occasions you'll need to be convinced, so it's important to leave
your ego at home. It's not a competition and it's not about being
right or wrong so questioning and discussions are important and need
not be taken personally. Remember the debate is about the ideas not
the people.

You also need to be patient, you may have a very clear idea but your
partner may not follow so try to explain things and help them
understand. Use a notebook or a drawing board, don't get frustrated if
you need to repeat things many times. At the same time sometimes you
just need to trust your partner. You may not understand clearly
despite their best intentions or may not agree exactly on how to do
things but let them show you their way. If after all the idea didn't
work out you'll both get something out of it, and the next attempt
will be much better as you won't have to repeat the same mistakes.

Be respectful when you talk try to avoid using bad words and
expressions, try to keep the session positive even when faced with
challenges (bugs, bad documentation, some third party failing,
etc). Keeping a good mood will help the sessions be lighter and less
stressful for both. And it's ok to keep your partner in check, if they
are being cranky or moody let them know and help them cheer up.

Taking breaks is also quite important. When you're pairing many of the
little distractions that plague us will not be there. Writing emails,
checking slack or some blog, twitter, news site, etc is not something
you can do with someone next to you so the increased focus will get
your mind tired after a while. When you're feeling tired go for a
coffee or take a walk, try to change subjects so that you can recharge
and get back to action feeling recharged.

And last but not least be clean. Have a shower, brush your teeth, it's
not a date but you'll be working very closely with someone so show
some courtesy. Also avoid using much perfume as some people can be
sensitive to it.

This is not an exhaustive list but try to follow those points and
you'll see how your pair programming sessions will be enjoyable and
after practicing some time you'll get comfortable and think how good
it feels to work this way.
