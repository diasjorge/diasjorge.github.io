## Experience
### **Intellum** – Director of Systems Engineering _(Jun 2023 – Present, Remote, US-based company, HQ in Atlanta, GA)_
_Enterprise Learning & EdTech_

As Director of Systems Engineering, I expanded my role beyond technical execution to focus on strategy definition, cross-functional collaboration, and delivering business impact. While continuing to lead the Systems Engineering team, I worked closely with engineering leadership, security, finance, and customer-facing teams to align infrastructure, security, and deployment strategies with company goals.

I developed the strategy for several critical security and compliance initiatives and led their implementation, including AWS SSO and AWS Organizations, reinforcing access management as code and reducing reliance on long-term credentials. I also played a key role in SOC2 audit preparation, ensuring security policies and infrastructure aligned with compliance requirements.

#### Key Achievements

- **Led security and compliance enhancements**, supervising SOC2 audit readiness and implementing improved access management.
- **Developed the strategy** for AWS security enhancements and **led the implementation** of access management as code, reducing reliance on long-term credentials.
- **Aligned engineering execution with business objectives**, ensuring collaboration between security, finance, and engineering teams.
- **Mentored and guided the team**, ensuring engineers were empowered to execute effectively while maintaining high operational standards.

### **Intellum** – Systems Engineering Manager _(Feb 2021 – Jul 2023)

As Systems Engineering Manager, I built and scaled the Systems Engineering team from a one-person operation to a fully staffed  team. I led a high-performing and successful remote team of five engineers across Europe and the US, giving them ownership while ensuring alignment with company goals.

I transitioned the team from a generalist Systems Engineering model to specialized roles, hiring Systems Engineers, DevOps Engineers, and SREs to enhance expertise and focus. This restructuring improved operational efficiency, strengthened collaboration, and positioned the team for long-term scalability as infrastructure demands grew.

I played a key role in cross-functional collaboration, ensuring infrastructure, security, and business priorities remained aligned. My leadership approach focused on empowering engineers while maintaining strong technical execution.
