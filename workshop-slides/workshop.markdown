- Automation is the use of control systems and information technologies to **reduce the need for human work** in the production of goods and services. In the scope of industrialization, automation is a step beyond mechanization. Whereas mechanization provided human operators with machinery to assist them with the muscular requirements of work, **automation greatly decreases the need for human sensory and mental requirements** as well. Automation plays an increasingly important role in the world economy and in daily experience.

The syntax is Rake-like, so it should be familiar to most Rake users.
