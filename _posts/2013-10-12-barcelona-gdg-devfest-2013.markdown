I was invited with my friend [Jean Carlos Meninno](http://meninno.com) to give a presentation on the [GDG DevFest Barcelona 2013](http://bcn.gdgdevfest.com/). It was a great opportunity to talk about the work we're doing recently for XING and the things we've been learning about developing large scale backbone applications.

Here you can find the slides: [http://diasjorge.github.io/google-dev-fest-slides/](http://diasjorge.github.io/google-dev-fest-slides/)

Hope you like them.
