It's been a while since I worked on the blog's design. The design
dated back to 2011 which is like an eon in Internet time and I didn't
particularly liked how it looked anymore so I decided to change it.

I normally don't do any design work and CSS is not something I've
enjoyed particularly but I've always used this space to work on that
area.<!-- -**-END-**- -->

I must say that css has greatly improved over the years. I didn't have
to do anything to make it look the same on different browsers. The
tooling in google Chrome is just amazing nowadays. You can see exactly
how different elements look, their box size, paddings, margins,
etc. It's a different experience from what I remembered and I enjoyed
the whole project quite a bit.

I'm a big fan of [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized). I
use it on my editor and on the terminal so I figured having my blog
with solarized would be a great idea :)

I used [solarized-css](http://thomasf.github.io/solarized-css/)
for the color scheme with the reset from
[skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) I had from my previous design.

One of the major changes is that the design was done for mobile first
and then changed it to adapt for bigger screens. I borrowed some ideas
about it from some blog posts like
[this](http://dmolsen.com/2013/03/05/media-query-less-design-content-based-breakpoints-tweakpoints/)
about doing media queries based on your content and not defined screen
sizes. I didn't use any responsive layout framework like skeleton and
just used css-grid now that most browsers support it to define the
content structure.

I'm happy with the end result, it's more up to date with my
preferences, I like that it's more colorful and less sober than it
was. I learned some new things and specially I had fun doing something
I'm not used to which is a great way to push myself and get out of the
comfort zone.

I hope you enjoy it too.
