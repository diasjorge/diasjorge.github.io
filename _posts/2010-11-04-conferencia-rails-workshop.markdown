As promised here are the slides for the "Conferencia Rails" workshop on process automation. Thanks to all the people that were there. I'm also releasing the redmine CLI I've created along with the CLI twitter client.

The presentation was created using the [slideshow](http://slideshow.rubyforge.org/) gem which generates an html document for you.

[Slides](/workshop-slides/workshop.html) To start the presentation just hit the "LEFT" arrow key. You can also find a pdf version [here](/workshop-slides/workshop.pdf).
