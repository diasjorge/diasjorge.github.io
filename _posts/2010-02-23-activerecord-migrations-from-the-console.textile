title: ActiveRecord migrations from the console
---

If you ever run into the situation where one migration doesn't complete sucessfully, and you're stuck with a column in a table or a new table, so you can't drop the migration or execute the migration again, you can always call the migration methods from the console like this:<!-- -**-END-**- -->

{% highlight ruby %}
ActiveRecord::Migration.drop_table :table_name
ActiveRecord::Migration.remove_column :table_name, :column_name
{% endhighlight %}

Hopefully this will help you when you're developing your migrations.
