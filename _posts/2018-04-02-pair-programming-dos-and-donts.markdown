There are several things that will make your pair programming sessions
work better. Things you can actively do and others best to avoid.

First of all, you need to give it an honest shot, especially if you're
not experienced in pairing. Pair programming is a skill and needs to
be learned. Like learning any other thing the process can be tough, it
can take you out of your comfort zone and get your mind resisting and
wanting to do things as usual. So it's important to be open about the
experience and try to make the best of it.<!-- -**-END-**- -->

Communication is crucial, you need to talk to your partner and learn
to listen. There is a quote by
[Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) which I
really like that says: *"Programming is the art of telling another
human being what one wants the computer to do"*. This has always stuck
with me since I first read it and when you're pairing it applies even
more. That's the essence of it.

Effective listening is necessary, listening to others is by no means
easy! Try to open to their suggestions and be aware of the interaction
you have with your partner. Don't rush through the task, take the time
so both understand clearly the goal.

You need to be patient, you may have a very clear idea but your
partner may not understand so try to explain things and help them
understand. Use a notebook or a drawing board, don't get frustrated if
you need to repeat things many times. At the same time sometimes you
just need to trust your partner. You may not understand clearly
despite their best intentions or may not exactly agree on how to do
things but let them show you their way. If after all the idea doesn't
work out you'll both get something out of it, and the next attempt
will work out much better as you won't have to make the same mistakes.

Code written by a pair is a construction of the best ideas by two
people and coming up with them, things need to be challenged. You'll
need to convince your partner and in some occasions you'll need to
convince yourself, so it's important to leave the old ego at home!
It's not a competition nor is it about being right or wrong so
questioning and discussing are vital and need not be taken
personally. Remember the deliberation is all about the ideas not the
people.

Be respectful when talking, try to avoid using bad words and
expressions, try to keep the session positive even when faced with
challenges (bugs, bad documentation, some third party failing,
etc). Stay positive! A good mood will help the sessions be lighter and less
stressful for both. And it's ok to keep your partner in check, if they
are being cranky or moody let them know and help them cheer up.

Taking regular breaks is also advisable. When you're pairing a lot of
the little distractions that plague us will vanish. Writing emails,
checking slack, reading blogs, twitter, news sites, etc is not
something you can do with someone next to you so the increased focus
will be draining after a while. When you feel tired go for a coffee or
go for a walk, try to change the environment so that you can recharge
and get back into action feeling fresh.

Last but not least, you'll be working shoulder to shoulder with
someone so consider your personal hygiene and avoid using too much
perfume or after shave as some people may be sensitive to it.

This is not an exhaustive list but by using these points you'll see
how your pair programming sessions become more enjoyable and after
practicing some time you'll get acquainted and see how working in this
way is worth it.
