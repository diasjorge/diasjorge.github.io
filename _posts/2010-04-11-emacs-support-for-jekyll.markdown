title: Emacs support for Jekyll

If you're using emacs to write your jekyll blog posts, there is a mode to help you with some common tasks. It is originally from [metajack](http://metajack.im/2009/01/02/manage-jekyll-from-emacs/). Recently I thought it could be a nice addition to have syntax highlight support for jekyll posts, so I got my hands dirty and after some hours of lisp hacking (this was my first attempt at lisp programming) it was a reallity. It is based on [nxhtml](http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/doc/nxhtml.html) so you need it to work.<!-- -**-END-**- -->

Here is an screenshot of it at work:
