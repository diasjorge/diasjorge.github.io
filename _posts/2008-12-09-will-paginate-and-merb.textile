I read something about how to do it in this "post":http://merbist.com/2008/10/27/will_paginate-and-merb/ by The merbist, albeit the information was not complete.
So here are my instructions:<!-- -**-END-**- -->

Clone mislav's will_paginate repo and build the gem from the agnostic branch.

{% highlight sh %}
git clone git://github.com/mislav/will_paginate.git
cd will_paginate/
git checkout origin/agnostic 
gem build
{% endhighlight %}

With this commands you've generated the will_paginate-3.0.0.gem.

If you want to install it system-wide use your usual gem install.
If you want to bundle it in your project, as I did, then you'll have to do:

{% highlight sh %}
thor merb:gem:install path/to/gem
{% endhighlight %}

That's it.
